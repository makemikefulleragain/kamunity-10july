## üéØ TECHNICAL CHANGES DEPLOYED

### **File Modifications**
| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `src/pages/index.tsx` | **Structure** | Updated hero container: `max-w-sm` ‚Üí `max-w-md`, enhanced decorative elements |
| `src/pages/about.tsx` | **Standardization** | Applied home page template structure with 50% size increase |
| `src/pages/content.tsx` | **Unification** | Replaced floating icons with standardized decorative elements |
| `src/pages/analytics-test.tsx` | **Linting Fix** | Replaced `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` components |
| `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` | **Hook Fix** | Added `validateForm` to useCallback dependencies |

### **Key Technical Improvements**
