## üö® CARDINAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

### 1. **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FIRST**
- **ALWAYS** identify the exact technical cause before making changes
- Never assume or guess - investigate systematically
- Use semantic search, file reading, and grep to understand current state
- Compare structures across pages to find precise differences

**Example from this session:**
- ‚ùå Wrong: "The gap looks different, let me try adding padding"
- ‚úÖ Right: "Home page uses `py-fluid-8 lg:py-fluid-12` inside container, About/Content use `py-fluid-16` on section - this creates double padding on home page"

### 2. **SCOPE DISCIPLINE - ZERO TOLERANCE**
- **NEVER** change anything not explicitly requested
- **NEVER** modify colors, fonts, layouts, or functionality unless asked
- **NEVER** add features or "improvements" during bug fixes
- Stick to the exact requirements with surgical precision

**What NOT to do:**
- ‚ùå Changing hero text colors during gap fixes
- ‚ùå Modifying feed layouts during image standardization  
- ‚ùå Adding animations during structure changes
- ‚ùå "Improving" code structure unless explicitly requested

### 3. **EXPERT PERSPECTIVE REQUIREMENT**
When user shows frustration with repeated failures:
- **IMMEDIATELY** stop current approach
- Apply expert-level systematic analysis
- Look at the problem from multiple technical angles
- Consider all factors: CSS specificity, inheritance, responsive breakpoints
- Use professional debugging methodology

## üî¨ TECHNICAL METHODOLOGY

### Problem Analysis Process
1. **Document Current State**: Read all relevant files completely
2. **Identify Exact Differences**: Use grep/search to find variations
3. **Root Cause Isolation**: Determine WHY differences exist
4. **Surgical Solution**: Make minimal, targeted changes only
5. **Verification**: Ensure solution addresses root cause only

### File Change Protocol
1. **Read Before Edit**: Always understand complete context
2. **Single Responsibility**: One fix = one specific issue
3. **Preserve Functionality**: Don't break existing features
4. **Consistent Structure**: Follow established patterns
5. **Test Build**: Verify compilation before committing

## üìä SESSION SUCCESS METRICS

### What Worked ‚úÖ
- **Expert Root Cause Analysis**: Identified double padding issue precisely
- **Surgical Fixes**: Only modified what was requested
- **Systematic Approach**: Used home page as authoritative template
- **Build Verification**: Fixed linting errors properly
- **Clean Deployment**: Successfully pushed to production

### What Failed Initially ‚ùå
- **Scope Creep**: Made unauthorized changes to colors/layouts
- **Assumption-Based Fixes**: Tried solutions without understanding causes
- **Incomplete Analysis**: Didn't compare all page structures systematically
- **Reactive Debugging**: Fixed symptoms instead of root causes

## üéØ FUTURE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### BEFORE Every Code Change
- [ ] **Understand Request**: What exactly is being asked?
- [ ] **Current State Analysis**: How do things work now?
- [ ] **Root Cause Identification**: Why is the issue happening?
- [ ] **Scope Boundary**: What should NOT be changed?
- [ ] **Solution Design**: Minimal changes to achieve goal

### DURING Development
- [ ] **Stay in Scope**: Only touch requested functionality
- [ ] **Test Incrementally**: Verify each change works
- [ ] **Preserve Structure**: Don't reorganize unless asked
- [ ] **Document Changes**: Clear commit messages
- [ ] **Build Verification**: Ensure production readiness

### AFTER Implementation
- [ ] **User Verification**: Does it solve the exact problem?
- [ ] **No Side Effects**: Did we break anything else?
- [ ] **Performance Check**: Build times and bundle sizes
- [ ] **Documentation Update**: Record lessons learned

## üèÜ TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE PRINCIPLES

### Code Quality Standards
- **Linting Compliance**: Fix all ESLint errors before deployment
- **React Best Practices**: Proper hook dependencies, component structure
- **TypeScript Precision**: Maintain type safety throughout
- **Performance Optimization**: Consider bundle size and render efficiency

### Architecture Consistency
- **Pattern Following**: Use established conventions
- **Component Reusability**: Standardize similar structures
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-first approach
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify compatibility
