# The Truth About AI Ethics in Community Moderation

I’ve been wrestling with how to automate moderation without losing our human touch. Today I share three spicy takeaways from our Ethics Debate roundtable on AI‑driven content flags. We asked: When algorithms decide what’s acceptable, who takes responsibility for mistakes?

Our panel landed on four core principles: transparency in model decisions, ongoing human oversight, clear appeal channels and bias audits.

**“If you can’t explain a decision, you shouldn’t make it.”**

We explored scenarios where AI flagged the wrong posts as hate speech and the harm that caused.

I reflect on how Kamunity can roll out moderation tools that empower rather than replace communities. By sharing audit results publicly, we build trust and invite community members to refine the filters.

Let’s build together by owning our tools and their impact. Jump into the Ethics Forum with your questions or concerns.
