# The Future of Digital Spaces

In this episode, Kai & Crew unpack the growing tension between centralised tech giants and emerging decentralised communities. What if our digital lives could be guided by shared values instead of shareholder value?

Youâ€™ll hear fresh takes from grassroots tech builders, including a spicy take on reclaiming online agency: "Platforms should serve the people, not the profit."

We also dive into how Kamunity is flipping the script on data ownership and collaborative governance.
