# New Member Onboarding Process Updated

We’ve just streamlined our welcome journey based on your feedback!

Newbies now receive a personalised orientation kit with bite‑sized tutorials, a community roadmap and an onboarding buddy invite within 24 hours. This reduces friction and helps fresh faces feel at home faster.

Clearer moments that matter and Kai support replace lengthy manuals, and our updated Welcome Chat pins and audio summaries keep key resources at the top for easy access.

**“A smoother welcome opens doors faster.”**

Data shows new members complete their first contribution 30% quicker and report higher confidence.

Let’s build together by making every step clear and supportive.

If you have suggestions for further tweaks, maybe a quick how‑to video or a glossary term, drop them in our Kamunity Onboarding Chat.
