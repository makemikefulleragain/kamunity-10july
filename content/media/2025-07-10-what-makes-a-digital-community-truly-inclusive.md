# What Makes a Digital Community Truly Inclusive?

In this curious conversation, I sit down with accessibility designer Miguel Santos. We unpack subtle design choices, colour contrast ratios, keyboard navigation flow and micro‑copy tone, that can either welcome or exclude newcomers. Miguel shares a case where a misplaced tab index stopped screen‑reader users in their tracks.

Highlights include his mantra: “Accessibility isn’t extra work, it’s the foundation of community for everyone.”

We tease out three quick wins: clear heading structures, skip‑to‑content links and meaningful alt text. You’ll hear examples from real‑life projects and practical tips to run an inclusion audit in under an hour.

We end with a challenge: What’s one tweak you can implement today to open doors to more voices? Post your plan in the Inclusion Thread and let’s learn together.
