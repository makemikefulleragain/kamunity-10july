## 📞 **DECISION POINTS**

### **Go/No-Go Checkpoints**
- [ ] **Week 1 Checkpoint:** Email + Database migrations successful?
- [ ] **Week 2 Checkpoint:** Voice system complexity manageable?
- [ ] **Week 3 Checkpoint:** Performance targets met?

### **Scope Adjustments**
- [ ] **If Voice System Too Complex:** Reduce to 9 variations (3×3) instead of 36
- [ ] **If Timeline Too Aggressive:** Extend to 4-week timeline
- [ ] **If Costs Exceed Budget:** Prioritize free tiers, defer premium features
