# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT FIX - NETLIFY BUILD FAILURE

## THE ACTUAL PROBLEM
Your Netlify build is failing because it's looking for your project in the wrong directory. Your Next.js app is in `MVP/MVP/kamunityAI` but Netlify is trying to build from the repository root.

## SOLUTION 1: FIX VIA NETLIFY UI (DO THIS FIRST - 2 MINUTES)

1. **Go to your Netlify Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to: Site Configuration â†’ Build & deploy â†’ Continuous Deployment**
3. **Click "Edit settings" under Build settings**
4. **Update these EXACT values:**

```
Base directory: MVP/MVP/kamunityAI
Build command: npm ci && npm run build
Publish directory: MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/.next
Functions directory: MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/netlify/functions
```

5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Go to "Deploys" tab and click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"**

## SOLUTION 2: ALTERNATIVE BUILD SETTINGS (IF SOLUTION 1 FAILS)

Try these settings in Netlify UI:

```
Base directory: MVP/MVP/kamunityAI
Build command: npm ci && npm run build && npm run export
Publish directory: MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/out
Functions directory: MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/netlify/functions
```

## SOLUTION 3: CREATE ROOT-LEVEL NETLIFY.TOML

If the UI changes don't work, create a new file at the ROOT of your repository (not in kamunityAI folder):

**File location:** `/netlify.toml` (at repository root)

```toml
[build]
  base = "MVP/MVP/kamunityAI"
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

## SOLUTION 4: MODIFY PACKAGE.JSON BUILD SCRIPT

Edit `MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "build:netlify": "next build && next export",
    "export": "next export"
  }
}
```

Then in Netlify UI use:
```
Build command: npm ci && npm run build:netlify
Publish directory: MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/out
```

## SOLUTION 5: NUCLEAR OPTION - RESTRUCTURE REPOSITORY

If nothing else works, move your project to the root:

```bash
# In your local repository
cd C:\Users\mikef\KUAI-MVP-9725
mv MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/* .
mv MVP/MVP/kamunityAI/.* .
rm -rf MVP
git add .
git commit -m "Move project to repository root"
git push
```

Then in Netlify:
```
Base directory: (leave empty)
Build command: npm ci && npm run build
Publish directory: .next
```

## DEBUGGING STEPS

1. **Check Netlify Deploy Log:**
   - Look for "Current directory" in the log
   - Verify it shows `/opt/build/repo/MVP/MVP/kamunityAI`
   - If not, the base directory is wrong

2. **Verify Build Command:**
   - Should show "npm ci && npm run build" executing
   - Should NOT show any "command not found" errors

3. **Check for Next.js Detection:**
   - Log should show "Using Next.js Runtime"
   - Should show "@netlify/plugin-nextjs" loading

## COMMON ERRORS AND FIXES

**Error:** "Your publish directory cannot be the same as the base directory"
**Fix:** Set publish to `.next` or `out`, not the same as base

**Error:** "No Next.js app found"
**Fix:** Ensure base directory points to where package.json is

**Error:** "Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2"
**Fix:** Usually means wrong directory or missing dependencies

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

1. **RIGHT NOW:** Go to Netlify UI and update the build settings as shown in Solution 1
2. **IF THAT FAILS:** Try Solution 2 settings
3. **STILL FAILING:** Create the root netlify.toml file
4. **LAST RESORT:** Contact me with the exact error from the deploy log

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

When it's working correctly, you'll see:
- "Found package.json at: ./package.json" (not at root)
- "Next.js app detected"
- "Build completed successfully"
- No "exit code: 2" errors

**IMPORTANT:** The key is making sure Netlify knows your app is in `MVP/MVP/kamunityAI`, not at the repository root!
